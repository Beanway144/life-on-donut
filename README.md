# life-on-donut
This solo project immitates Conway's Game of Life, but cells that move off the right of the grid end up on the left, cells that end up off the top wrap to the bottom, etc.

When run, enter a grid size (an integer) which will be the length of one side of the grid. Then, enter the coordinates shown that will be initialized as alive, (like 31,32,41,42). Then, enter the number of iterations (an integer).
